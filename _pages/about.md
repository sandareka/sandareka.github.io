# Hi, I am Sandareka.

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the National University of Singapore (NUS), supervised by Professor [Wynne Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~whsu/) and Professor [Mong Li Lee](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leeml/). I earned the Bachelor of the Science of Engineering (Hons) in [Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.mrt.ac.lk/) from the [University of Moratuwa](https://uom.lk/) in 2014.

I am interested in designing accurate and interpretable Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In particular, I am interested in explaining the actual reasons behind DNN decisions in natural language. My focus is developing methods to explain already-trained DNNs or developing inherently interpretable DNNs, in the domain of computer vision. I believe that improved understanding and performance will bolster public confidence in Artificial Intelligence (AI), leading to the increased adaption of AI systems in the real world.
