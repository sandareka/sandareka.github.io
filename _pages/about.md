# Hi, I am Sandareka.

I am a PhD candidate at National University of Singapore (NUS) supervised by Professor [Wynne Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~whsu/) and Professor [Mong Li Lee](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leeml/). I earned Bachelor of the Science of Engineering (Hons) in [Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.mrt.ac.lk/) from [University of Moratuwa](https://uom.lk/) in 2014.

I am interested in designing accurate and interpretable Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In particular, I am interested in explaining the reasons behind DNN decisions in natural language. My focus is developing methods to explain already-trained DNNs or developing inherently interpretable DNNs in the domain of computer vision.
